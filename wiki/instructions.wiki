==Shock code in cartesian geometry==

The code to use is 

*graale_idmhd.f90*

To compile it, use the command

*compila*

You might have to modify it to change it for your compiler. g95 is assumed.

To picture the results with matlab (and with small modifications for octave), use:

*mfig.m*

== Self similar expanding solutions ==

The distributions includes the latests version:

*mhdLP.f90*

and some previous older versions: 
mhd.f90         
mhdL.f90      
mhdLn.f90

The use of mhdLP is recommended.

To compile it, use your favourite compiler. For example:
_g95 -O2 mhdLP.f90_

To look at the results there are three matlab files with slightly different output, the last one being in good for black and white publishing: 
*self.m*          
*self2.m*         
*self2_BW.m*
