# Introduction #

GrAALE  is an acronym for Grid Adaptation ALE, a code developed by Giovanni Lapenta. It is a Lagrangian-Eulerian project. The demos provided below are just lagrangian but some versions are available from the developer with rezoning and remapping for full ALE capability.

**If you use this code, please, reference both papers listed below and explicitly name it as GrAALE giving me the credit for the painful time spent developing it. I might have done a bad job, but I tried to do it right.**

Please contact _giovanni.lapenta AT wis.kuleuven.be_ for more details.

The versions here are

  1. a 1D shock in MHD plasmas, as described in the fluid section of the following paper: [Lapenta, G., and J. King (2007), Study of current intensification by compression in the Earth magnetotail, J. Geophys. Res., 112, A12204, doi:10.1029/2007JA012527. ](http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2007/2007JA012527.shtml)
  1. a  1D  astrophysical application of self-similar expanding magnetic flux ropes. The method and use is described in: [J.M. Finn, G. Lapenta, H. Li, Similarity Solutions for Magnetic Bubble Expansion, Physics of Plasmas, 11, 2082-2096, 2004.](http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&id=PHPAEN000011000005002082000001&idtype=cvips&gifs=yes)
